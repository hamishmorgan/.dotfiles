# Machine-specific git configuration
#
# Copy this file to ~/.gitconfig.local and customize for this machine
# This file is git-ignored and won't be tracked in the repository
#
# Use for:
# - Machine-specific git signing configuration
# - Local git aliases
# - Machine-specific credential helpers
# - Git hooks or tool integrations
#
# NOTE: The main .gitconfig includes this file via:
#   [include]
#       path = ~/.gitconfig.local

# Example: Git signing with 1Password (personal laptop)
# Template already has format=ssh and 1Password program, so just set key:
# [user]
#     signingkey = ssh-ed25519 YOUR_SSH_KEY_HERE

# Or override both format and program:
# [gpg]
#     format = ssh
# [gpg "ssh"]
#     program = /opt/1Password/op-ssh-sign

# Example: Git signing with Yubikey (Shopify laptop)
# Override format to openpgp, then include Shopify's managed config:
# [gpg]
#     format = openpgp
# [include]
#     path = ~/.config/dev/gitconfig.yubikey

# Example: Disable signing (if not needed)
# [commit]
#     gpgsign = false

# Example: Machine-specific aliases
# [alias]
#     work-log = log --author="work-email@company.com"

# Example: Local credential helper
# [credential]
#     helper = custom-helper
