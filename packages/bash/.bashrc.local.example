# shellcheck shell=bash
# Machine-specific bash configuration
# 
# Copy this file to ~/.bashrc.local and customize for this machine
# This file is git-ignored and won't be tracked in the repository
#
# Use for:
# - Machine-specific aliases and functions
# - Local environment variables
# - Private API keys or tokens
# - Tool configurations specific to this machine
#
# NOTE: Shopify dev tools (dev.sh, tec agent) will automatically append
# their initialization code to ~/.bashrc. This is expected behavior.
# The main .bashrc file pre-includes these integrations, so tool appends
# will create duplicates that can be safely ignored or removed.

# Example machine-specific aliases
# alias work='cd ~/work'
# alias home='cd ~/personal'

# Example environment variables
# export CUSTOM_VAR="value"

# Example tool configuration
# export EDITOR="code"
