# Stow configuration file
# This file sets default options for all stow operations
# See: man stow

# Set default verbosity level
# 0 = silent, 1 = show what stow is doing, 2+ = debugging info
--verbose 1

# Do not fold newly stowed directories
# This keeps the directory structure cleaner and more predictable
--no-folding

# Dotfiles mode: remove leading dot from package filenames and add them back when stowing
# This is useful for versioning dotfiles without dots in package names
# NOTE: Not using this as our packages already have dotfiles with dots
# --dotfiles
