# Link Presentation Rules

## Link Format

When presenting links to users, the link text MUST be identical to the URL.

**Format:**

```markdown
[https://example.com/path](https://example.com/path)
```

**Why:**

- Users can see the exact URL they're clicking
- Links are clearly clickable in markdown
- URL is visible for copy/paste if needed
- Consistent presentation across all links

**Examples:**

✅ **CORRECT:**

```markdown
[https://example.com/page](https://example.com/page)
```

❌ **INCORRECT:**

```markdown
[Click here](https://example.com/page)
[Open link](https://example.com/page)
https://example.com/page (plain text, not clickable)
```

**When to use:**

- All external links
- Search query URLs
- API documentation links
- Any URL that should be clickable

**Exception:**

Only use descriptive link text when the URL itself is not meaningful or user-friendly
(e.g., shortened URLs, internal IDs). In such cases, still include the URL in parentheses
or nearby for reference.
