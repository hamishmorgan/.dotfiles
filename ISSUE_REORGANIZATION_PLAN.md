## ‚úèÔ∏è UPDATE WITH CONTEXT

### #11 - Expand documentation with advanced usage and troubleshooting

**Add comment:**
```
## Status Update

**Partially addressed - Core documentation exists**

Current documentation structure:
- ‚úÖ **README.md**: Comprehensive user-facing documentation (installation, usage, features, configuration, troubleshooting section)
- ‚úÖ **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Complete developer documentation (setup, workflow, testing, CI, architecture, debugging)
- ‚úÖ **AGENTS.md**: Detailed AI agent instructions (technical implementation guidance, code standards, patterns)
- ‚úÖ **tests/README.md**: Testing framework documentation
- ‚úÖ **Inline help**: `./dot --help`, `./dot status`, `./dot health`
- ‚úÖ **Troubleshooting sections**: Present in README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md

**What's still missing (from original proposal):**
- ‚ùå Dedicated `docs/` directory with topic-specific guides
- ‚ùå Advanced configuration cookbook/examples
- ‚ùå Platform-specific configuration guide
- ‚ùå Integration examples (tool-specific configurations)

**Priority remains LOW** since core documentation is comprehensive. Advanced guides would be nice-to-have for power users but aren't blocking any workflows.

Consider splitting this into specific issues if particular documentation gaps are identified (e.g., "Document SSH package setup", "Create multi-machine configuration guide").
```

### #18 - Add secrets management integration

**Add comment:**
```
## Status Update

**Partially addressed by PR #63 - Security audit command**

The `./dot security` command (added in PR #63) now provides:
- ‚úÖ Detection of committed secrets in tracked files
- ‚úÖ Validation of `.secret` file permissions (must be 600/400)
- ‚úÖ Verification of `.gitignore` coverage for secret files  
- ‚úÖ SSH private key permission checks
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive security audit reporting

**What's still missing from original proposal:**
- ‚ùå Encryption at rest (git-crypt, sops, age)
- ‚ùå Encrypted storage for secret files
- ‚ùå Multi-machine secret synchronization
- ‚ùå Secrets rotation management

**Current approach (template + gitignore + audit)** provides:
- Separation of public templates from private secrets
- Git-ignored secret files (not in version control)
- Security validation via `./dot security`
- Per-machine secret management (different secrets per machine)

**Priority remains MEDIUM**. Current approach is functional and secure for most use cases. Encryption would add defense-in-depth for scenarios where:
- Secrets need to be in version control (shared team configurations)
- Backup encryption is required
- Compliance mandates encryption at rest

Consider re-evaluating when multi-machine secret sync (#45) is implemented, as that would benefit from encryption.
```

### #43 - Add comprehensive shell completion with descriptions

**Add comment:**
```
## Status Update  

**Partially addressed - Basic completion exists with recent additions**

Recent enhancements:
- ‚úÖ `diff` command with completion support (PR #XX)
- ‚úÖ `security` command with completion support (PR #63)  
- ‚úÖ Updated bash and zsh completions
- ‚úÖ Fish shell completion support
- ‚úÖ Basic command completion works

**What's still missing from original proposal:**
- ‚ùå Command descriptions in completions (help text while typing)
- ‚ùå Package name completion for enable/disable commands
- ‚ùå Backup ID completion for restore command (dynamic completion)
- ‚ùå Inline help text in completion menu
- ‚ùå Enhanced zsh completion with `_describe` and `_arguments`
- ‚ùå Context-aware argument completion

**Current state:**
- Bash: Suggests commands only
- Zsh: Better with _describe but could be enhanced
- Fish: Basic completion works

**Priority remains MEDIUM**. Current completion is functional. Enhanced descriptions and context-aware completion would improve UX but aren't blocking workflows.

The original implementation proposals in the issue body are still valid and can be referenced when this is prioritized.

### #68 - Comprehensive Code Quality & Maintainability Improvements

**Add comment:**
```
## Implementation Status

This is a **meta-issue** that tracks comprehensive code quality improvements. The specific tasks are broken down into individual issues:

**Sub-issues (all remain open):**
- #81 - Replace eval in rollback mechanism with function-based approach (medium priority, security)
- #82 - Extract large functions into smaller, testable helpers (medium priority, code quality)
- #83 - Consolidate package metadata into single data source (low priority, code quality)
- #84 - Implement verbosity-aware logging functions (medium priority, code quality)
- #85 - Standardize platform detection with centralized variables (low priority, code quality)
- #86 - Extract stable utilities to lib/ directory (low priority, architecture)
- #87 - Add unit tests for complex functions (medium priority, testing)

**Progress:**
- 0/7 completed
- 3 medium priority (start with these)
- 4 low priority

**Recommended order:**
1. #87 (Add unit tests) - Enables safer refactoring
2. #81 (Remove eval) - Security improvement
3. #82 (Extract functions) - Improves testability
4. #84 (Verbosity logging) - Enhances UX
5. #85, #83, #86 (Architecture cleanup)

**Note:** Each sub-issue should be implemented independently with its own PR. This meta-issue tracks overall progress but doesn't need to be closed until all sub-issues are complete.

Consider this a roadmap for incremental code quality improvements rather than a single large refactoring effort.
```

## üìù NEW ISSUES TO CREATE

### Missing Issue: Container Runtime Abstraction

**Title:** Abstract container runtime to support both Docker and Podman

**Body:**
```markdown
## Problem

Local CI (`./tests/run-local-ci.sh`) hardcodes `docker` commands. Users running Podman (RedHat/Fedora default, rootless containers) must manually edit scripts or create docker‚Üípodman aliases.

## Current State

```bash
# Hardcoded in run-local-ci.sh
docker build -t dotfiles-test-ubuntu -f tests/docker/Dockerfile.ubuntu .
docker run --rm dotfiles-test-ubuntu
```

Fails on systems with Podman but not Docker.

## Proposed Solution

Detect available container runtime and use it:

```bash
# Auto-detect container runtime
detect_container_runtime() {
    if command -v docker &>/dev/null; then
        echo "docker"
    elif command -v podman &>/dev/null; then
        echo "podman"
    else
        log_error "No container runtime found (docker or podman required)"
        return 1
    fi
}

CONTAINER_RUNTIME=$(detect_container_runtime)

# Use detected runtime
$CONTAINER_RUNTIME build -t dotfiles-test-ubuntu ...
$CONTAINER_RUNTIME run --rm dotfiles-test-ubuntu
```

## Benefits

- Works on Docker and Podman without modification
- Better Linux distribution support (Fedora, RHEL use Podman)
- Rootless container support (Podman default)
- Explicit error if neither available

## Priority

**Low** - Workaround exists (docker alias), but improves portability.

## Labels

- enhancement
- low-priority
- ci
- developer-experience
- portability
```

### Missing Issue: Windows/WSL Support

**Title:** Add Windows/WSL support and documentation

**Body:**
```markdown
## Problem

Dotfiles repository targets macOS and Linux but doesn't document or test Windows/WSL compatibility. Many developers use WSL for development.

## Current State

- No mention of Windows/WSL in README.md or DEVELOPMENT.md
- No CI testing on Windows
- Unknown if scripts work in WSL environment
- Platform detection may not handle WSL correctly

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Documentation
- Add WSL installation instructions to README.md
- Document WSL-specific considerations
- Note any known limitations

### Phase 2: Platform Detection
- Update platform detection to identify WSL
- Handle WSL-specific paths (/mnt/c vs /c)
- Detect WSL 1 vs WSL 2

### Phase 3: Testing
- Add WSL test to local CI (if feasible)
- GitHub Actions: Test on Windows with WSL

### Implementation

```bash
# Platform detection enhancement
detect_platform() {
    case "$(uname -s)" in
        Linux)
            if grep -qi microsoft /proc/version 2>/dev/null; then
                echo "wsl"
            else
                echo "linux"
            fi
            ;;
        Darwin) echo "macos" ;;
        *) echo "unknown" ;;
    esac
}

# WSL-specific handling
if [[ "$PLATFORM" == "wsl" ]]; then
    # WSL-specific configurations
    # May need different SSH agent handling
    # May need different PATH modifications
fi
```

## Benefits

- Broader platform support
- Better documentation for Windows developers
- Confidence in WSL compatibility

## Considerations

- WSL 1 vs WSL 2 differences
- Windows filesystem limitations
- SSH agent forwarding from Windows
- Git credential management

## Priority

**Low** - WSL users can likely use it already, but formal support would be valuable.

## Labels

- enhancement
- low-priority
- documentation
- platform-support
- wsl
```
